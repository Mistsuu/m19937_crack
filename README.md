# `randcracks`: Tools to crack random functions.

This repository will provide tools to crack random algorithm *(currently only `mt19937` from Python's `random` module is supported)*. It is made **100%** for educational purposes only *(and fun :happy:)*. And while there're already many repos that can do this, I also want to create some more relaxed, while systematic way to crack random algorithms, instead of having to transform outputs everytime to suit the other programmer's code :>
